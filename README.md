# TheShiftGame
Small procedural shooter made with Pygame

So, this is my small personal project about using cell-automate procedural generation. Now I am student of first year in MIPT and making this project as assignment for informatics cource.

The main idea is to make a virtual world which is constantly changing around player and it's not only about some sort of life simulation. According to the plot, the fabric of the universe was damaged by some experiment on "Callisto" station on same-named Jupiter moon and all around lose constant form and place, if only there isn't some kind of stability field generator (as on main character)
